                        <p class="section__text">Sarah was born in the south during 1850. She became a free woman after
                            1865,
                            and
                            moved to Chicago to open a furniture store. Her customers mostly lived in small apartments,
                            and
                            had
                            little room for things like a bed and a desk. Wanting to find a way to save space while
                            still
                            having
                            essential pieces of furniture, she drafted up an idea.</p>

                        <p class="section__text">As a solution, she created the “folding bed’. When needed, it could be
                            used
                            as
                            a
                            desk, but when unfolded, it functioned as a bed. Wanting to own her idea, Sarah got a patent
                            for
                            her
                            invention on July 14th, 1885. And with that, history was made! Sarah became the first

                            American

                            older
                            sister. In
                            school, Annie took a liking to chemistry, while also experimenting with hairstyles on
                            herself
                            and
                            her
                            sister. At the time, many African American women sought to straighten their hair, but could
                            only
                            use
                            damaging oils and grease to achieve the look. Annie wanted to study the different textures

                            black

                            on to patent a version of a hot comb for straightening hair, and develop other hair care
                            products.
                            In
                            1906, she trademarked her products under the name “Poro”. She also began to train other

                            use

                            nationwide.
                            Becoming
                            one of the first black female millionaires in the US, she often gave much of her wealth to
                            charities
                            and
                            orphanages to aid the black community. She is considered the mother of black beauty and

                            heating

                        <p class="section__text">Patricia Bath was born in New York during 1942. Her interest in science
                            was
                            sparked
                            when her mother bought her a chemistry set at a young age. She graduated high school in just
                            two
                            years,
                            and by 1973, Patrica became an ophthalmologist, a doctor for the eyes. She was inspired to
                            bring
                            eye
                            care to those who couldn’t afford treatment in black communities. Access to treatment
                            matters if
                            the
                            patient has a cataract, a medical condition that clouds their eyesight and can cause
                            blindness.
                            Patrica
                            wanted to find an easier, less painful way to remove cataracts.</p>

                        <p class="section__text">With the groundbreaking use of laser technology, Patrica developed the
                            Laserphaco
                            Probe. This device removed an entire cataract with a laser beam, something doctors had never
                            been
                            able
                            to do. A patent was filed in 1986, making Patricia the first African American female doctor
                            to
                            receive a
                            medical patent. She took her discoveries abroad often, restoring the sight of people who had
                            been
                            blind
                            for years. She also co-founded the American Institute for the Prevention of Blindness.

                        <p class="section__text">Marian was born in Pennsylvania during 1955. Her father encouraged her
                            to
                            pursue
                            science as a young girl, helping her build a chemistry lab in their home. Right after
                            receiving
                            her
                            PHD,
                            she joined AT&T in 1982. But it wasn’t until the early 90s that Marian realized wired line
                            telephones,
                            the
                            old way of communicating, would become obsolete. From there, she became an important voice
                            in
                            the
                            company's advancement.

                        <p class="section__text">Marian steered AT&T to use Internet Protocol for their communication
                            devices.
                            Using
                            the internet for cell phones improved the quality of voice calling, texting, and later,
                            video
                            calling.
                            It is almost impossible to credit Marian with one specific patent, for she has been granted
                            over
                            300
                            in
                            her lifetime. But in 2005, she received a patent for the technology that helps people make
                            charitable
                            donations through text. This has been used during several crisis situations and natural
                            disasters.
                            In
                            2014, she joined Google and is currently in charge of expanding internet access around the
                            world.
